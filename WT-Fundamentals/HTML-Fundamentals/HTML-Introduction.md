##HTML Example
###[A small HTML document](https://jsbin.com/kahuze/edit?html,output):
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

##Example Explained
* The **DOCTYPE** declaration defines the document type to be HTML
* The text between **<html>** and **</html>** describes an HTML document
* The text between **<head>** and **</head>** provides information about the document
* The text between **<title>** and **</title>** provides a title for the document
* The text between **<body>** and **</body>** describes the visible page content
* The text between **<h1>** and **</h1>** describes a heading

##HTML Tags
HTML tags are **keywords** (tag names) surrounded by **angle brackets**:
```
<tagname>content</tagname>
```
* HTML tags normally come **in pairs** like <p> and </p>
* The first tag in a pair is the **start tag**, the second tag is the **end tag**
* The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a **slash** before the tag name
**Note:**	The start tag is often called the opening tag. The end tag is often called the closing tag.
