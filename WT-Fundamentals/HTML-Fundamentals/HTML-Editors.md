#WTF / HTML Fundamentals / Editors

##Write HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit
HTML can be edited by using professional HTML editors like:
**Microsoft WebMatrix**
**Sublime Text**
However, for learning HTML we recommend a text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).
We believe using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.
Follow the 4 steps below to create your first web page with Notepad.  

##Step 1: Open Notepad
To open Notepad in Windows 7 or earlier:
Click Start (bottom left on your screen). Click **All Programs**. Click **Accessories**. Click **Notepad**.
To open Notepad in Windows 8 or later:
Open the **Start Screen** (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad. 

##Step 2: Write Some HTML
Write or copy some HTML into Notepad.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

##Step 3: Save the HTML Page
Save the file on your computer.
Select **File** **>** **Save as** in the Notepad menu.
Name the file "index.html" or any other name ending with html or htm.
UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for HTML files.
ANSI encoding covers US and Western European characters only.
